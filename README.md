# UFC Fighter Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the outcome of UFC fights based on fighter statistics such as weight, number of wins and losses, and other relevant features. The goal was to build a machine learning model to predict the winner of a fight, as well as the potential method of victory (e.g., knockout, submission, decision).
